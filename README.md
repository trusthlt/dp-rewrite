# DP-Rewrite: Towards Reproducibility and Transparency in Differentially Private Text Rewriting

## Description

DP-Rewrite consists of command-line tools (later APIs) to easily perform differentially private text rewriting on a given dataset. Implemented with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), our library provides models and out-of-the-box datasets for running experiments with [differential privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dwork.pdf) to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. Concretely, we provide tools for pre-training a text rewriting model (most commonly an [autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder)), rewriting a dataset with differential privacy using this pre-trained model, and running downstream experiments on original and rewritten datasets. Additionally, our library allows for the seamless incorporation of custom datasets and custom models into the framework.

## Quick Start: Running Experiments

Steps to running an experiment:
1. Choose a **mode** (`pretrain`, `rewrite`, or `downstream`, see **Modes** below for more details).
2. Choose a **model**. Currently only `adept` is available for pre-training and rewriting, and `bert_downstream` for downstream classification.
3. Choose a desired dataset (see **Custom Datasets** below if you want to use your own dataset).
4. Specify a **name** for your experiment with `--name`. This will be the folder name associated with your experiment where checkpoints, configuration info, learning curves, various statistics and rewritten data will be saved to.
5. Specify two main directories: (1) `--output_dir` where the above folder will be saved and (2) `asset_dir` where datasets will be loaded from. See **Directories** below for more information.
6. Finally, you can configure additional hyperparameters for the experiment such as `--batch_size` and `--learning_rate`. For a complete list of available arguments, you can run `python main.py -h`.

For sample experiment runs, please look at the shell scripts provided in `sample_scripts`. These contain test commands covering the most important basic arguments.

Additionally, if you are on a machine with low resources, you can specify `--local True`, setting `--local_iter_size` to the desired number of iterations per epoch to run the model.

Please read the short introduction about the three available modes below.

### Modes

There are 3 modes of experiments:

1. `pretrain`: This is used for training/fine-tuning an autoencoder model on some data.
2. `rewrite`: This is used for loading a checkpoint of an autoencoder model (provide the checkpoint with param `last_checkpoint_path`) and running it over a whole data set (= rewriting the dataset).
3. `downstream`: This is used for training and/or evaluating a downstream model on some data. Can be done on the raw datasets we provide (see below) or on rewritten data (use parameters `--dataset custom` and provide the associated path with `--custom_train_path`, as well as optionally `--custom_valid_path` and `--custom_test_path`). More information in **Custom Datasets** below.

### Pre-defined Experiments

Optionally, it is possible to specify a pre-defined experiment with `--experiment` which simplifies the above **Quick Start** process by pre-selecting parameters associated with a given experiment (e.g. *mode*, *model*, etc.).

If using a pre-defined experiment, any conflicting parameters specified will be overridden.

The specific list of parameters can be seen in `prepare_specific_experiment` of `utils.py`. The currently available experiments are outlined below:

- Please specify `--dataset custom`, along with  `--custom_train_path` (also optionally `--custom_valid_path` and `--custom_test_path`).
- If `--custom_valid_path` is not provided, training and validation sets will be prepared from the training path, with split ratio according to `--train_split_ratio`.
- Datasets should be in CSV format, with one column for 'text', and optionally a second column for 'labels'. If `--prepend_labels` is True, labels will be prepended to each row's text for `pretrain` and `rewrite` modes.
- Test data is not used for the `pretrain` mode.

## Available Models

### Autoencoders

| Model Name | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|
| `adept` | Our reference implementation of Adept. As the Adept paper lacks info about the exact network structure, some architecture decisions were made by us. | Timour |

### Downstream Models

| Model Name | Description | Author |
|---|---|---|
| `bert_downstream` | A BERT model with a feedforward head (output dimension based on the number of classes in the dataset). The specific type of transformer can be specified with `--transformer_type`. | Timour |

### Custom Models

It is also possible to include a custom model for the experiments. The procedure is as follows:

- Depending on whether the model is RNN- or Transformer-based, fill out the `CustomModel_RNN` or `CustomModel_Transformer` classes, respectively. These can be found in `models/autoencoders/custom.py`.
- Alternatively, a user-made model class can inherit from these custom classes.
- The expected inputs/outputs of the `forward` method are specified in the docstrings of these custom model classes.
  - `CustomModel_RNN`:
    - Input: Dictionary of input values with key-value pairs as follows:
      - `input_ids`: `torch.LongTensor` (`batch_size` X `seq_len`)
      - `lengths`: `torch.LongTensor` (`batch_size`)
      - `teacher_forcing_ratio`: `float`
    - Return:
      - `torch.DoubleTensor` (`batch_size` X `seq_len-1` X `vocab_size+4`)
  - `CustomModel_Transformer`: 
    - Input: Dictionary of input values with key-value pairs as follows:
      - `input_ids`: `torch.LongTensor` (`batch_size` X `seq_len`)
      - `attention_mask`: `torch.LongTensor` (`batch_size` X `seq_len`)
    - Return:
      - `torch.DoubleTensor` (`batch_size` X `seq_len-1` X `vocab_size`)
- Any new arguments required for the model that are not currently part of the framework can be added with the CMD argument `--custom_model_arguments`, which will be available as a list under the custom model class `self.config.custom_config_list` variable.
  - E.g. `--custom_model_arguments alpha beta gamma` --> `self.config.custom_config_list == ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']`

## Project Structure

- ``assets`` sub-folders contain the (raw) data of training datasets and embeddings.
- ``models``
    - ``autoencoders`` contains all (PyTorch) autoencoder models that are used to privatize the data, each in its own python file.
    - ``downstream_models`` contains all (PyTorch) models that tackle a downstream task, each in its own python file. They can be used with original or rewritten data.
- ``sample_scripts`` contains tests for different datasets and experiments.
- ``download.py`` can be used to download datasets and embeddings to the assets folder.
- ``dataload.py`` is the main dataloading script which prepares existing and custom datasets.
- ``experiments.py`` contains three types of "experiments" and the main training/evaluation loops for the framework.
- ``main.py`` can be executed from the command line with arguments to run experiments (see Quick Start above).
- ``preprocessing.py`` contains preprocessing pipelines that transform the data according to a model's needs. Separate pipelines are implemented for transformer and RNN-based models.
- ``settings.py`` specifies all the arguments that `main.py` can be run with.
- ``utils.py`` contains additional helper functions and classes (e.g. `EarlyStopping`)

## Directories

### Overview

If you want to use the **default folders** in the project structure for data, logs, stats, and so on, you don't need to
specify any paths for using autoencoders and you only need to specify `embed_dir_unprocessed` if you want to train/use
an RNN-based model with pre-trained embeddings (`--embed_type` as `glove` or `word2vec`).

If you want to **load the project in an IDE**, it's a good idea to set `output_dir` & `asset_dir` to paths outside the project folders, as some IDEs will take very long to index large amounts of data that may be written into these folders.

### Details

**Output directories**:

- `output_dir`: Stats & logs (defaults to `<project_root>/results`)
- `dump_dir`: Directory for things that might need much storage (e.g., model checkpoints & rewritten data) (defaults to `output_dir`)
- In each of these directories, data will be written to a custom experiment name (if none is given, this is set to the current timestamp)

**Input directories**:

- `asset_dir`: Where to look for assets like datasets and processed embeddings (defaults to `<project_root>/assets`)
- `embed_dir_unprocessed`: Where to look for pre-trained word embeddings when using RNN-based models.
  - Specify the actual path of the embeddings, not the parent folder.
  - 'Unprocessed' refers to the original word embedding models, not modified for specific experiments (e.g. subsampled vocabularies based on frequency in a given dataset). The 'processed' embedding directory is automatically created under `asset_dir` during preprocessing.
- `data_dir`: If you store your data somewhere else than the other assets, you can specify the path here (defaults to `asset_dir`)

All paths should be specified as global paths.
